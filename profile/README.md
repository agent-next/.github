# Agent Next

Proof-first infrastructure for autonomous software teams.

AI agents can ship code quickly. We make sure they ship code that can be trusted: verified, reproducible, and merge-ready.

## Start Here

- [agent-ready](https://github.com/agent-next/agent-ready)
  Codebase operability standards for agent-readable repositories.
  [![npm](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/agent-ready)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/agent-ready)
- [behavior-driven-testing](https://github.com/agent-next/behavior-driven-testing)
  Proof-first testing discipline for acceptance, regression, and evidence.

- [cc-manager](https://github.com/agent-next/cc-manager)
  Multi-agent orchestration in isolated worktrees, with budget controls and merge-safe delivery.
  "I need a [Boris](https://x.com/bcherny) to manage my Claude Code."

## Operating Principle

Agent output is untrusted until proven correct.

Every change needs:

- Acceptance proof: does it satisfy the task?
- Regression proof: does it preserve existing behavior?
- Evidence trail: what was tested, and what passed?

## Roadmap

See [ROADMAP.md](https://github.com/agent-next/.github/blob/main/ROADMAP.md) for current priorities.
