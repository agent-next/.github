# Agent Next

**Open research lab for next-gen autonomous agents.**

We explore the core capabilities that define the next generation of AI agents: **self-organizing**, **self-verifying**, and **self-evolving** — and build open-source reference implementations to prove them out.

## Research Directions

| Direction | Question | Project |
|-----------|----------|---------|
| **Self-Organizing** | How do agent teams decompose work, coordinate, and resolve conflicts autonomously? | [cc-manager](https://github.com/agent-next/cc-manager) |
| **Self-Verifying** | How can agent output prove its own correctness without human review? | [behavior-driven-testing](https://github.com/agent-next/behavior-driven-testing) |
| **Self-Evolving** | How do agent systems improve from their own execution history? | [cc-manager evolution pipeline](https://github.com/agent-next/cc-manager) |

## Open Source Projects

- **[cc-manager](https://github.com/agent-next/cc-manager)** — Research platform for autonomous agent orchestration. Parallel agents in git worktrees, self-evolution from execution data, proof-first merge pipeline.
- **[agent-ready](https://github.com/agent-next/agent-ready)** — Codebase readiness scoring for autonomous agents. Beyond instructions — measurable operability standards.
- **[behavior-driven-testing](https://github.com/agent-next/behavior-driven-testing)** — Verification discipline for agent-generated changes. Acceptance proof, regression safety, evidence trails.
- **[TeamClaw](https://github.com/agent-next/teamclaw)** — Multi-agent team platform for cross-project coordination with shared memory and role-based access.

## Ecosystem

- **[LabClaw](https://labclaw.org)** — AI-native scientific lab platform. First vertical application of Agent Next infrastructure, proving autonomous agent teams in experimental science.

## Thesis

Current-generation agents follow instructions. Next-generation agents learn, verify, and improve autonomously. The bottleneck is shifting from *writing code* to *trusting code* — and the infrastructure for that trust doesn't exist yet. We're building it.
