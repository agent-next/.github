# Agent Next

**Untrusted until proven.** Open verification standards for AI agents.

AI agents that ship code without verification ship bugs at scale. We build the open-source standards, verification frameworks, and orchestration primitives that make autonomous delivery trustworthy.

## What We Build

```
 ┌───────────────────────────────────────┐
 │  Multi-Agent Orchestration            │  Scalable collaboration primitives
 ├───────────────────────────────────────┤
 │  Proof-First Verification    ← core  │  Acceptance · Regression · Evidence
 ├───────────────────────────────────────┤
 │  Codebase Operability                 │  Standards for agent-readable repos
 └───────────────────────────────────────┘

| Orchestration | Multi-agent coordination primitives | In development |

## Core Idea

Agent output is untrusted until proven correct. Every delivery needs:
- **Acceptance proof** — does it meet the spec?
- **Regression proof** — does it break anything?
- **Evidence trail** — what was tested, how, and by whom?

This is the "proof-first" principle that runs through everything we build.

## Roadmap

See [ROADMAP.md](https://github.com/agent-next/.github/blob/main/ROADMAP.md) for what we're building now, next, and later.
