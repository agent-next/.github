# Security Policy

## Reporting a Vulnerability

Please do not open public issues for security vulnerabilities.

Preferred:
1. Go to the affected repository on GitHub.
2. Open the **Security** tab.
3. Use **Report a vulnerability** to submit a private report.

If private reporting is not available for a given repository, contact the maintainers via GitHub: **@robotlearning123**.

## Scope

This policy applies to all repositories under the **agent-next** GitHub organization.

## Response Targets

- Acknowledgement: within 72 hours
- Triage: within 7 days

## Coordinated Disclosure

We may request a reasonable window for coordinated disclosure to ensure users can upgrade safely.
